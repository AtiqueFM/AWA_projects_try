Software Version 	:- 4.1.0
copied from 		:- 4.0.0
Date 				:- 06/12/2022
Major Features 		:- 
						1. UART6 with DMA for RX and TX.
						2. PLL Fclk at 50MHz
Updates 			:-
						1. Code Clean-Up.
						2. Addition of three header and source file:
							i.   Application (.c/.h)
							ii.  Calibration (.c/.h)
							iii. Initialization (.c/.h)
<BUG 1>				:-	1. UART 1 is not working along side with DMA.

Date 				:- 06/01/2022
Update 				:- 
						1. <BUG 1> RESOLVED.
							Cause :- Resetting of UART 1 NVIC IRQ enable bits resulted in disabling the interrupt request.

Date				:- 12/01/2022
Updates				:- 
						1.Shifted the UART 1 to DMA.
						comments:- Testing remaining.
Risk				:-
						1.<RISK 1> PENDING
						Cause :- Check for UART	TC (Transfer complete flag), wait untill its set and then clear it 
								 by writing '1' to it.
					    Comment :- Not implemented yet.
					    
Date				:- 13/01/2022
Updates				:- 
						1. Added the caluclted pH values to the HMI display instead of the ADC counts.
						2. Implemented in pHsensotGetValue().

Date				:-13/01/2022
Updates				:- 
						1. Added new register in Input register for :-
							1. COD
							2. BOD
							3. TSS
							These register will hold the values which will be only seen by the developer.
							and will be viewed on check and factory setting display.
						2. Chnages alos applied in CODCapture()

Date				:- 27/01/2022
Update				:- 
						1. Added MODBUS for HMI over DMA, handling the query except multiple preset input coil.
						  TESTED over MODSCAN.

Date				:- 13/01/2022
Updates				:- Added the COD and TSS check screen, including
						1. Screen switch commands.
						2. read acid
						3. read sample
						4. set as zero
						
Date				:- 28/01/2022
Updates				:- Merged COD and TSS check branch with COD modbus map change branch cobined with master branch.


Date				:- 01/02/2020
Updates				:- 
						1. Full fledged HMI MODBUS with DMA.
						2. RTU on DMA.
						3. Temperature cable resistance.
						4. Only positive value for customer and -ve values for developer.
						5. Check Screen.
						6. Holding register spare resister space for every section.
